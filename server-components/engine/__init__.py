"""
World-engine subsystem.

Re-exports the top-level type the rest of the server passes around — the
`Engines` bundle. It's a frozen dataclass so callers can pass the managers
without anybody mutating it through the bundle. Submodule classes
(`WorldEngineManager`, `SceneAuthoringManager`) are
imported under `TYPE_CHECKING` so this module stays light at import-time;
the heavy torch / transformers waterfall only fires when the submodules
themselves are imported (from `main.py`'s instrumented try-block).
