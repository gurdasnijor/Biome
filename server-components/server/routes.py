"""
HTTP and WebSocket endpoints for the Biome server.

Exposes a `router: APIRouter` with the `/health` probe, the
`/api/model-info/{model_id}` HF metadata proxy, and the `/ws`
WebSocket entry point. The router is mounted onto the FastAPI `app`
in `main.py`; this module is import-safe and process-agnostic.

The WebSocket endpoint stays a thin protocol shell: it owns transport
lifecycle (accept, dispatch by phase, close, top-level error reporting)
and delegates every internal concern to the module that owns it.
Phases run top-to-bottom; each is one well-named call:

  - log streaming           → `util.server_logging.stream_logs_to_client`
  - startup wait            → `ServerStartup.replay_to`
  - progress drain          → `Connection.run_progress_drain`
  - pre-init handshake      → `server.session.handlers.run_preinit_handshake`
  - warmup + init + frame   → `server.session.handlers.prepare_session`
  - recorders               → `Connection.start_recording_segments`
  - game loop               → `server.session.workers.run_session`
  - cleanup                 → `Connection.teardown`

`app.state` carries the resources the lifespan populates: `engines`
(an `Engines` bundle) and `startup` (`ServerStartup`).
The typed accessors below pull each piece individually so endpoints
take only what they need rather than reaching through a god object.
