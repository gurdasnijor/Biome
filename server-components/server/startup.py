"""
Lazy engine init + startup-progress signaling for the WebSocket layer.

`ServerStartup` lives on `app.state.startup` for process lifetime and owns
two responsibilities:

  - **Lazy engine load.** The heavy GPU stack (world_engine, transformers,
    diffusers) is constructed on the first WS connect via
    `ensure_engines_loaded`, not at process startup. Server boot stays
    fast — info-only endpoints (`/health`, `/api/model-info`, …) respond
    immediately while the GPU pieces are still uninstantiated.

  - **Stage broadcast.** While the lazy load runs, the connecting client
    needs to see progress. `mark_stage` records each `STARTUP_*` stage
    and fans it out to every WS client subscribed via `replay_to`.
    Subsequent connects find `complete=True` and short-circuit.

`init_lock` serialises concurrent first-connects (defence in depth — the
single-session gate already prevents two simultaneous sessions). On
failure, `error` is sticky for the rest of the process so retrying clients
get a deterministic `SERVER_STARTUP_FAILED` instead of attempting to
reload a broken stack.
